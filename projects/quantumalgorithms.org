The website https://quantumalgorithms.org is an open-source book on quantum algorithms. We have two goals. 
First, we want to close the gap between the typical introductory course in quantum computing and research papers in quantum algorithms. 
Secondly, we aspire to be the go-to reference for lemmas and theorems needed for the quantum algorithm researcher to write new algorithms and applications of known quantum algorithms.

Now the book is mostly focused on quantum machine learning algorithms but is also touching topics like quantum algorithms for Monte Carlo, lower bounds in query complexity, and numerical experiments on real datasets. 
We have a sizable appendix, covering topics from error propagation to the foundation of linear algebra, and all the things needed to understand quantum algorithms from a computer science perspective.
