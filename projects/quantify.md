Quantify enables quantum computing users to program pulse-level physics experiments in a hardware-agnostic manner (currently supporting Qblox and Zurich Instruments control hardware) through `quantify-scheduler` (https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-scheduler), and to automate data acquisition and execution of these experiments with `quantify-core` (https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-core).
