Quantify is a collection of modules which enable quantum computing users to program pulse-level physics experiments in a hardware agnostic manner (currently supporting QBlox and Zurich Instruments backends) through quantify-scheduler (https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-scheduler), and to automate data acquisition and execution of these experiments with quantify-core (https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-core).
