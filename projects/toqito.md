The toqito package is an open source Python library for studying various objects in quantum information, namely, states, channels, and measurements.

toqito can be used to do some of the following tasks:

- Estimate quantum and classical values of nonlocal games.
- Optimizations for quantum state distinguishability scenarios.
- Functions for exploring measures of entanglement and entangled states.
- Perform operations on and determine properties of quantum states, channels, and measurements.
- Support for generating random quantum states and measurement operators.
- Pure Python module that easily integrates into existing projects.

More information on toqito can be found via the [documentation](https://toqito.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [website](https://vprusso.github.io/toqito/) and 
[this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R7qSszJwBI) that provides an overview of some of the functionality.
