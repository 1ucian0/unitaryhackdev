[Qiskit](https://qiskit.org) is an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of pulses, circuits, and application modules.

The `qiskit-terra` component is the foundation on which the rest of Qiskit is built. Includes tools to build circuits and transpile them, besides a quantum information module and visualization tools. It also comes with a circuit library.
