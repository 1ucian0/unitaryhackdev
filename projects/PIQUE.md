People Interested in Quantum Universal Education is a non-profit community that aims to disseminate educational resources about quantum.

Open source oriented community that shares different educational resources for learning in the area of computing.

For those of you who have an idea or a resource that doesn't match those issues, you can share it and you will get a free t-shirt from our community.
